# Multiple Disease Detector for Predicting Humans Chronic Diseases Using Machine Learning


![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()


This paper proposes a Multiple Disease Detector is a web based application for predicting
humans long term illnesses like Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease,...etc,
combined with Machine Learning(ML) and Python for creating this useful web-application
project. The goal is to help people to check their health if they want, it checks if they are
affected with chronic diseases or not? without having a formal consultation with a doctor.
And it is easier to access to anyone worldwide, more friendly to use and an organised
user-friendly interface(UI).

The Machine Learning(ML) project involves the use of a user or active dataset and it gives
more accurate values while the users input the information about their condition. Users can
directly access the web-application by using browsers with any devices. The Multiple
Disease Detector offer features such as early detection of diseases, information of diseases
and worldwide access of site. Users can individually check the detector for predicting
disease by entering the given blanks.

To address the diseases, ML techniques are validating the entered details with the help of a
pre-trained dataset and after validation, the system gives the accurate answer. For each
disease, the web-page includes some blank boxes related to that disease. Once the users fill
the blank boxes with valued details, it displays the one-line result by clicking the "submit"
button.

By combining Machine Learning(ML), this implementation aims to increase the accuracy of
the results for finding the real-time input. And this system gives beware of diseases to users
and makes an alert/care about the precautions to prevent the dangerous situation
